Navigating the App
==================

Webadmin is a web application and you can use it on any device with a web browser that has access to your server. This means that the app will look different on various form factors, for example a phone.

After logging in, you will see a permanent app bar up at the top and a navigation menu on the left. These are always available regardless of current context.

> Note that the navigation may be hidden on narrower screens. To toggle it, use the hamburger menu icon on the far left of the app bar or swipe from the left edge on a touch screen.


App Bar and the Dashboard
-------------------------

![Dashboard](../_media/img/overview/dashboard.png)

The Dashboard is your main overview of the system's current status. You can always go back there by clicking the Dashboard button __(1)__.

The app bar is always at the top, and, in the case that it is hidden, gives you access to the navigation. On the right side, there is your profile name and a button to open the notification drawer. Clicking the profile name will bring up the account flyout __(2)__, where you can see your role and permissions, go to the Account page or sign out. The notification drawer shows all of the notifications you received about job statuses and more. They are shown from newest to oldest.

An excerpt for the system monitor is also shown on the Dashboard __(3)__, along with the status of jobs and hosts in the system. Below, you'll find latest job statuses in a bit more detail __(4)__.
