## What is Hashstation?

**Hashstation** is a distributed password cracking system. It can be used for recovering passwords securing various types of encrypted media like documents, archives, or disk volumes, as well as for breaking raw cryptographic hashes.

Thanks to the integration with [Hashcat](https://hashcat.net/) tool, Hashstation provides a wide range of supported formats and great speed with the use of proper hardware. The computation is hardware-accelerated by using OpenCL technology and thus, the cracking can be performed on all OpenCL-compatible CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, DSPs, or coprocessors.

Our system is based on [BOINC](http://boinc.berkeley.edu/) framework for distributed computing which allows Hashstation to provide a relatively high level of automatization whithout limiting the flexibility of the system, or administratorâ€™s freedom of creating a custom design and configuration of a distributed network.

Hashstation was created within the [NES@FIT](http://www.fit.vutbr.cz/research/groups/nes@fit/index.php.en) reasearch group on [Faculty of Information Technology, Brno University of Technology](http://www.fit.vutbr.cz/.en). Rather than a ready-made product, it represents an experimental prototype primarily used for research and testing of new password recovery techniques. It is freely available under [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) Since Hashstation is an experimental prototype, you can only use it at your own risk. We will not be held in any way responsible for your decision.
