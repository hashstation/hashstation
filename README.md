# Hashstation

Welcome to Hashstation, a distributed password cracking system enhanced for modern cybersecurity challenges. This system is designed for efficient decryption of hashed passwords using distributed computing, harnessing the power of multiple machines to accelerate the cracking process. Our improvements focus on a modern, user-friendly interface and enhanced stability, incorporating real-world feedback and experiences. With new features like advanced hashcat options, support for multiple rules, and cryptographic wallet compatibility, our system offers versatility and power for cybersecurity professionals, IT experts, and enthusiasts. 

# Why Hashstation ?

Our system stands out from Fitcrack and Hashtopolis due to several key enhancements and features, making it a superior choice for contemporary password cracking challenges:

## Modern User Interface

We've revamped the user interface to be more intuitive and user-friendly, enabling easier navigation and operation, which is particularly beneficial for those new to password cracking systems.

## Enhanced Stability

Drawing from real-world user experiences, our system boasts increased stability, reducing downtime and improving overall reliability, especially in extensive and continuous cracking sessions.

## Advanced Customization

Users have more control with options like custom hashcat arguments, workload profile adjustments, and the ability to select specific device types (CPU/GPU) for cracking tasks, offering tailored experiences for different needs.

## Support for Multiple Rules: 

Unlike the original Fitcrack, our system allows the application of multiple rules simultaneously, either in series or as a dot product, greatly enhancing the effectiveness and efficiency of the cracking process.

## Cryptographic Wallet Compatibility: 

Unique to our system is the ability to extract and crack hashes from various cryptographic wallets, a feature catering to the growing need for security in the cryptocurrency domain.

## Improved Scheduling and Benchmarking Logic

We've refined the scheduling and benchmarking logic for more predictable and precise workunit sizes, leading to better resource management and time efficiency.
